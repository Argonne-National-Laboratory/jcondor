# jCondor
A graphical front-end for HTCondor 

jCondor was used as a GUI for monitoring clusters running 
HTCondor (http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/).
It is designed to display information on the HTCondor job submissions using a web browser 
(jobs, users, CPU load). The program is written in Java and can be used as an applet. 
The program was developed to monitor  job resources,  query job status and users. 

<h1>How to use</h1>

Step 1:

Make sure HTCondor is installed. 
Check it on Linux/Mac OS as:

> chmod 755 ./consor.sh 
> ./consor.sh

You will see filled text files in the "current" directory generated by condor.
If not, correct settings in the bash script "condor.sh"


Then run the program as:

> java -jar jcondor.jar

Do not forget to refresh the status.
